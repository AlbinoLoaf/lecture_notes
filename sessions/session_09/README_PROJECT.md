You have to work on the following topics.

- [Your turn now! -- Project Work](#your-turn-now----project-work)
  - [1) Software Development](#1-software-development)
  - [2) Process](#2-process)


Remember, you have to perform work on each topic and on **each** bullet point.
Be done with the project work before we meet again next Thursday.


## 1) Software Development

1. SQL Server / Azure SQL

    - Update your application to run on SQL Server locally using either Docker or SQL Local DB (Windows only).
    - Ensure your tests are still running - using SQLite in-memory and/or test containers.
    - Run your *production* code with Azure SQL.

1. Create Cheeps

    - Extend your `CheepRepository` to support create (test and implement).
    - Using `FluentValidation` to ensure all inputs are valid.
    - Add a *cheep form* to your app which is only visible when a user is signed in.
    - Ensure a user can only post to the form if she is signed in.

1. UI Tests

    - Add UI tests for login with test user and send cheeps (optional???)

## 2) Process

Continue to automatically deploy your _Chirp!_ application to Azure App Service.
