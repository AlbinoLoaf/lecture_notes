# **Analysis, Design and Software Architecture (BDSA)**
Session 10
[Rasmus Lystr√∏m, Senior Cloud Solution Architect](rnie@itu.dk)


## Feedback: New Checks

I created a new set of automatic checks, that try to log into your _Chirp!_ applications and that try to send cheeps: <http://209.38.208.62/report_razor_apps2.html>

<iframe src="http://209.38.208.62/report_razor_apps2.html" width="100%" height=500 scrolling="auto"></iframe>


## Feedback: Read carefully!

Links to login should have `login` as link text, see [the project description](../session_08/README_PROJECT.md).

```html
    <div class=navigation>
        ...
        else
        {
            <div>
                <a href="/">public timeline</a> |
                <a ... >register</a>
                <a ... >login</a>
            </div>
        }
    </div>
```

Our automatic checks get quite complex when searching for `login`, `Login`, `Log-in`, `Log-In`, `signin`, `Signin`, `sign in`, `Sign in`, `Sign-in`, ...


## Feedback: Too many open tasks

I believe you are struggling with completing the project work from the last weeks:

- Sending cheeps
- Login with GitHub
- Migrate database to hosted database on Azure
- + Tasks from this week

How could you handle the situation of too many open and pressing tasks?
* Prioritization
* If you were to order, which are the most important and which are the least important tasks from the list above?


## Survey: How many groups have issues moving to hosted DB?

## First Hour Next Week: Guest Lecture

Next week, we start the lecture with a guest lecture. **Be on time**

## Identity

* It‚Äôs not about where you are
* it‚Äôs about who you are

## Zero Trust

### 1. Verify explicitly

#### Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points.

### 2. Use least privilege access

#### Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection.

### 3. Assume breach

#### Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.

## Network

**network** noun

*a system of computers and peripherals that are able to communicate with each other*

<https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/network>

## Network

### The most secure network is no network at all

Antiforgery middleware is added to the [Dependency injection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection) container when one of the following APIs is called in `Program.cs`:

```txt
AddMvc
MapRazorPages
MapControllerRoute
MapBlazorHub
```
