You have to work on the following topics.

- [Your turn now! -- Project Work](#your-turn-now----project-work)
  - [1) Software Development](#1-software-development)
  - [2) Process](#2-process)
  - [3) Demo Day](#3-demo-day)



Remember, you have to perform work on each topic and on **each** bullet point.
Be done with the project work before we meet again next Thursday.


## 1) Software Development

### Add feature(s): Wild Style

Implement whichever feature you like to your _Chirp!_ applications.
In case you have the time and energy, you might implement multiple such features.

For inspiration, wild style features might be:
- Ranking or liking of cheeps
- Tags in cheeps (for example, strings preceded by a `#` sign might be indexed and cheeps containing tags might be listed in a separate page)
- List of trending cheeps based on likes or tags
- Support of images in cheeps
- "Re-cheeping", i.e., forwarding of cheeps that are send by others to own timeline and own followers.
- ...


## 2) Process

Make sure that the above features are tested in a suitable form.


## 3) Demo Day

Prepare for the Demo day next week (Thursday, 7/12/23).
You present your work to each other in clusters of five (and one cluster of six) groups.
Each group has 10 minutes to present. The remaining time in the time slots is used for discussions and feedback.

**OBS**: All times given below are sharp! That is, they are not with an academic quarter.
